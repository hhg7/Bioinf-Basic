# fasta_index and fasta_region. Every expected value is htslib's or
# samtools's, checked on 2026-11-11:
#
# - htslib 1.25, test/faidx: t/data/faidx.fa is its faidx.fa, the index
#   expected of it is its faidx.fa.expected.fai, and the first regions fetched
#   are those of the "Fasta retrieval tests" in its faidx.tst, with the
#   sequences of its faidx.1.expected.fa. The lengths are the ones that file's
#   faidx_seq_len tests expect. t/data/faidx_reference.pl gives the notice
#   those files are distributed under.
# - samtools 1.19.2 (htslib 1.19): what "samtools faidx" printed for the other
#   regions, and how it took each file that cannot be indexed.
#   t/data/faidx_reference.pl runs it and prints both.
