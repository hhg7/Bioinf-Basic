# t/data/blood.vcf was written by t/data/make_blood_vcf.pl on 2026-11-10; its
# header says what each sample tests. It has a record for every marker of
# share/blood_type_panel.tsv, so nothing in it rests on a marker being absent.
#
# The expected types of its 16 samples are what t/data/blood_reference.py, a
# second implementation of the same rules that shares no code with the module,
# printed under Python 3.14.2 on 2026-11-10, with a min_depth of 7 and of 0:
#
#   python3 -I t/data/blood_reference.py share/blood_type_panel.tsv t/data/blood.vcf 7
#
# The cases after those are small VCFs written here, which test what that file
# cannot: a marker the file has no record of, a record of RHD's deletion, and
# GRCh38. Their expected values were worked out by hand from the rules in the
# README on 2026-11-10, and each case says which rule it is.
#
# The panel itself was checked against real genomes, which no smoker has: the
# README gives the counts for 1000 Genomes, and for three exomes whose RhD
# types are known from the depth of their reads over RHD.
