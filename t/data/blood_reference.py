# blood_type's answers for t/data/blood.vcf, worked out independently in
# Python, for t/blood.t's expected values. It reads the panel and the VCF as
# plain text and prints, for each sample, its type, ABO genotype and
# phenotype, RhD genotype and phenotype, and how many RHD sites it carries an
# ALT allele at. The tests never run it. Run it from the distribution root as
#
#   python3 -I t/data/blood_reference.py share/blood_type_panel.tsv t/data/blood.vcf 7
#
# where the last argument is min_depth. On 2026-11-10, under Python 3.14.2, it
# printed what t/blood.t expects, with 7 and with 0.
#
# It shares no code with Cn::Bioinf and is written the other way round: where
# Bioinf.xs tests each record against the panel, this indexes the VCF by
# position and looks each marker up; where the module counts chromosomes with
# a working gene and takes B and O2 from them, this lists the two alleles a
# sample has. It reads only a file that has a record for every marker, which
# t/data/blood.vcf does, so nothing here stands for blood_type's "assume_ref",
# and it knows nothing of a deletion record; t/blood.t says where those cases'
# expected values come from.
