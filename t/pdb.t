# t/data/pdb_search.json holds what RCSB's search API and data API answered
# pdb_search on 2026-10-21 for human haemoglobin alpha (UniProt P69905), cut
# down to five hits, as t/data/make_pdb_fixtures.pl says. The tests replay it
# in place of _rcsb_post, so that they need no network.
#
# The expected alignment fields are RCSB's own, from that file, except for
# identity, gaps, pident and query_cover, which RCSB does not give; they were
# counted from its aligned sequences by Python on 2026-10-21 (identity is the
# columns where the two agree and neither is a gap, gaps the "-" in either,
# pident 100 * identity / alignment_length, query_cover 100 * (query_end -
# query_beg + 1) / query_length), and pident is checked against RCSB's own
# sequence_identity, which it truncates to 3 places. The structure fields are
# the data API's, from the same file.
#
# With NETWORK_TESTING set, one search is also made of the real RCSB.
