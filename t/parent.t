# t/data/parent.vcf, and the own VCFs t/data/parent.{C,F,S,U}.vcf of four of
# its samples, were written on 2026-10-18 by t/data/make_parent_vcf.pl, whose
# header says what they hold: a made-up family of seven (F and M the parents
# of C and S, U unrelated, D a second genotyping of C, G the child of C and U)
# over 2,000 SNVs, then the records that parent skips or reads specially.
#
# The counts, t (sites by the child's and the parent's ALT count, flattened
# as t[3 * child + parent]) and the sites in both files or in one alone, are
# what t/data/parent_reference.py, an independent count with cyvcf2 0.34.0,
# printed for the same files on 2026-10-18. The other fields follow from them:
# IBS0, IBS1, IBS2 and the het and hom-ALT counts by their definitions, and
# the kinship by KING-robust's between-family formula. That formula, and
# parent's counts, were checked that day against PLINK 2.0.0-a.7.13LM's
# --make-king-table counts (--vcf-min-dp 10), which agreed exactly: on
# t/data/parent.vcf less its "edge" records (which PLINK cannot read), whose
# kinships are frozen below as @Plink, and on two of one family's exomes
# merged by bcftools 1.21 (merge -0, then view -m2 -M2 -v snps), where NSNP,
# HETHET, IBS0, HET1_HOM2, HET2_HOM1 and KINSHIP were 150976, 43728, 458,
# 37170, 39095 and 0.258656 from both.
#
# The decisions are those of README.md: parent and child when the IBS0 rate is
# below max_ibs0 (0.012, peddy 0.4.3's) and the kinship between KING's 0.177
# and 0.354.
