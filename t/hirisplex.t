# t/data/hirisplex.vcf was written by t/data/make_hirisplex_vcf.pl on
# 2026-10-20; its header says what each record and each sample's genotypes
# cover. Samples A, B and C carry two, one and no copies of every counted
# allele, and E is A with one edge case in five.
#
# The expected genotypes are what t/data/hirisplex_reference.py, a second
# implementation of the same rules reading the same file through cyvcf2
# 0.34.0 under Python 3.14.2, printed on 2026-10-20:
#
#   venv/bin/python -I t/data/hirisplex_reference.py t/data/hirisplex.vcf 7
#
# The expected probabilities are what t/data/trait_reference.py, which applies
# the definition of a multinomial logistic regression to the same genotypes
# and t/data/trait_model.tsv, printed on the same day. That model is made up
# and says so: HIrisPlex-S's own coefficients are not published, and this
# distribution ships no model.
#
# The genotypes of the insertion and lower-case records near the end were
# worked out by hand from the rules on 2026-11-02, and are what
# t/data/hirisplex_reference.py printed for each of them that day.
#
# The CSV that hirisplex_genotypes writes is compared against
# t/data/hirisplexs_template.csv, the webtool's own upload template,
# downloaded from https://hirisplex.erasmusmc.nl/examples/hirisplexs.csv on
# 2026-10-20. That file is the authority for the column names and their order,
# so a panel that drifts from it stops being uploadable.
