# t/data/sex.vcf was written by hand on 2026-10-18. Its four samples are F
# (heterozygous on X), M (mostly hom-ALT), H (haploid calls, as a caller that
# knows a sample is male writes them) and N (no calls on X). Its records hold
# each case sex_check skips (an autosome, X's and Y's PARs on GRCh37 and on
# GRCh38 and their bounds, an indel, a multi-allelic site, an ALT of ".", a
# FORMAT with no GT) and each kind of genotype it counts (phased, haploid,
# triploid, an allele of 2, "./1", a DP below 7, a DP of ".", no DP, GT after
# DP), under chromosomes named chrX, X, 23, chrY, Y and 24, and bases in lower
# case.
#
# The expected counts are what t/data/sex_reference.py, peddy 0.4.3's
# counting loop run through cyvcf2 0.34.0, printed for the same file on
# 2026-10-18 with min_depth 7 and 0; the sexes and het_ratios follow from
# them by peddy's rule (male when x_het / x_hom_alt is below 0.6). On that day
# the script and sex_check also gave identical counts for five genomes, which
# are not in the distribution; they are why peddy's 0.6 is kept, being about
# three times the highest male ratio and a third of the lowest female one:
#
#   genome.vcf.gz  whole genome  x_het 1990, x_hom_alt 68035  0.029 male
#   exome.vcf.bz2    exome         x_het   81, x_hom_alt   784  0.103 male
#   father.vcf.gz                 exome         x_het  246, x_hom_alt  1226  0.201 male
#   daughter.vcf.gz                 exome         x_het 1514, x_hom_alt   912  1.660 female
#   mother.vcf.gz                 exome         x_het 1563, x_hom_alt   913  1.712 female
