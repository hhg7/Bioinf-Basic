# t/data/pgs.vcf and t/data/pgs_weights.txt were written by hand on
# 2026-10-17, the weights in the layout of the PGS Catalog's PGS000138.txt.gz
# (format 2.0). Between them they hold an effect allele that is the ALT, one
# that is the REF, one that is the second of two ALTs, a multi-allelic site
# split into two records, a variant whose alleles disagree with the VCF's
# (rs4, A/G against T/C), one the VCF does not have (rs6), one whose VCF ID is
# "." (rs5), a no-call, a phased genotype, a sample that leaves DP off, and
# chromosomes named "chr1" in the VCF and "1" in the weights.
#
# The expected scores for matching by position are PLINK v2.0.0-a.6.9LM's
# (29 Jan 2025), run on 2026-10-17 as
#
#   plink2 --vcf t/data/pgs.vcf --set-all-var-ids 'chr@:#:$r:$a' --make-pgen --out p
#   plink2 --pfile p --score w.txt 1 2 3 header no-mean-imputation cols=+scoresums --out s
#
# where w.txt is pgs_weights.txt with each variant named by the ID that gave
# its record (the multi-allelic one is chr1:300:G:A, as $a is the first ALT
# alone). It printed
#
#   #IID ALLELE_CT NAMED_ALLELE_DOSAGE_SUM SCORE1_AVG SCORE1_SUM
#   S1   10        3                       0.185      1.85
#   S2   10        4                       0.335      3.35
#   S3    8        6                       0.3375     2.7
#
# and skipped one variant as absent and one for "a mismatching allele code".
# ALLELE_CT is "alleles" here, and SCORE1_AVG is "average". PLINK 2 matches
# on IDs, not positions, so the IDs above stand in for the position matching
# that pgs_score does; and it doesn't check the other allele, which agrees
# with the VCF's wherever the effect allele does in this fixture. The scores
# for matching by ID, and the cases built in this file, were counted by hand.
#
# Since 2026-10-17 pgs_score has PLINK 2 (Alien::Bioinf's v2.0.0-a.7.13LM, of
# 15 Oct 2026) do the scoring, and the values above check that it hands PLINK
# 2 the right records and alleles. Where PLINK 2's counting differs from a
# count by hand -- a haploid call on X -- the case says so.

# The fixtures, as Stats::LikeR's read_table returns them: the VCF as a hash of
# hashes keyed by CHROM:POS:REF:ALT, with each sample's column split into
# <sample>.<FORMAT key> (undef where a sample leaves a key off), and the weights
# as an array of hashes. This stands in for read_table, so that the test needs
# only the module; the block at the end checks it against read_table itself.
