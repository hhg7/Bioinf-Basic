# t/data/parent.vcf and the own VCFs t/data/parent.{C,F,S,U}.vcf are
# t/parent.t's, written by t/data/make_parent_vcf.pl, whose header says what
# they hold: a made-up family of seven (F and M the parents of C and S, U
# unrelated, D a second genotyping of C, G the child of C and U).
#
# The counts of every pair, t (sites by the first sample's and the second's
# ALT count, flattened as t[3 * first + second]) and the sites in both files or
# in one alone, are what t/data/parent_reference.py, the independent count
# with cyvcf2 0.34.0 (numpy 2.5.4, Python 3.14.2) behind t/parent.t, printed
# for each pair of the same files on 2026-10-19, at min_depth 10. The other
# fields follow from them as in t/parent.t. The kinships in @Plink are PLINK
# 2.0.0-a.7.13LM's --make-king-table (--vcf-min-dp 10) for every pair of
# t/data/parent.vcf less its "edge" records, run the same day.
#
# The relationships, which sample is the parent, and the categories are the
# family's, as make_parent_vcf.pl draws it, and not what relatedness made of
# the counts. The sexes come from the X records that with_x() below adds, in
# which a male is never het; the counts of each sample are compared with what
# sex_check, which t/sex.t checks against peddy, makes of the same file.
#
# On 2026-10-19 relatedness was also run on peddy's ceph1463.peddy.vcf.gz
# (17 samples of the CEPH 1463 pedigree, three generations; not in the
# distribution) and agreed with its ceph1463.ped on all 17 sexes and on 134 of
# the 136 pairs, each father, mother, son, daughter, brother and sister, and
# which of each parent and child was the parent, included. The other two were
# a grandfather and a grandmother with their grandson NA12893, whose kinships,
# 0.0839 and 0.0799, are below KING's 0.0884 and so third-degree.
