/*FASTA reading and writing for Cn::Bioinf, the genotype counts behind its
sex_check, parent, relatedness, concordance, hirisplex_genotypes and
blood_type, and (since 2026-11-11) the codon and k-mer loops behind translate,
translate_six_frames, find_orfs and kmer_count.

fasta2hash() and hash2fasta_file() used to be pure perl in ~/Scripts/bioinf.pm:
one readline, chomp and string append per line in, and one substr-sized SV per
80-column line out. Here a file is read in large blocks and every line of a
record is appended straight onto that record's SV, so no per-line SV is ever
made, and each finished sequence is shrunk to its length, which is the RAM a
proteome or genome actually needs rather than whatever the last buffer growth
left. On the file described at FASTA_BLOCK below, bioinf.pm read it in 3.83 s
with a peak RSS of 1,098 MB, and this in 0.80 s and 967 MB, 900 MB of which is
the sequences themselves; writing it back took 44.44 s and takes 0.97 s, and
the two files are byte-identical. Dropping the whitespace in sequences, which
began on 2026-10-17, costs about 15%: a made-up file of the same shape (938 MB,
400,000 records of 2,280 residues in 60-column lines, in the page cache) took
0.85 s to read before and 0.98 s after, best of five timed inside perl. The
perl side (lib/Cn/Bioinf.pm) opens and closes the files.

Every croak() and warn() here starts with C99's __func__, so a message names
the C function that raised it (read_fasta, write_fasta, translate_codons,
kmer_tally, or one of the vcf_, sex_, parent_, rel_, conc_, hps_ and bt_ ones)
and stays right if one is renamed.*/

/*`restrict` is spelled bare, which is C99 syntax.

It is carried only by read_fasta()'s block buffer, which this file allocates
itself and reaches through nothing but that pointer and the ones derived from
it. Every other pointer here is perl's: an SV, AV or HV, or the PV inside one,
which the perl API may alias behind the code's back -- in write_fasta() a
defline and its sequence can be COW copies of the one buffer -- so the
qualifier would be a false promise. perl is built with -fno-strict-aliasing,
where `restrict` is the only disambiguation there is, but it earns nothing even
on the buffer: the loop over it stores only through memchr() and sv_catpvn(),
which are opaque calls the compiler must assume write anywhere. The generated
code for this file was byte-identical with and without it (gcc -O2 -std=gnu99,
2026-09-30), so the one annotation records the contract rather than buying
speed.

Makefile.PL probes for a C99 flag but cannot always find one. MSVC accepts the
keyword only under /std:c11 or later and otherwise spells it __restrict, older
gcc spells it __restrict__, and a strict C89 compiler has no equivalent. Map it
where a spelling exists and define it away where none does -- the same block as
~/Scripts/stats/LikeR.xs. It sits below every #include so that it cannot
rewrite a parameter named `restrict` inside a system header.*/

that record's sequence (undef if it is absent), reading no further than the

gets each defline in file order.

A repeated defline is warned about and its sequences concatenated, which is
what bioinf.pm did: it is the file that is wrong, and nothing here can say
which of the two records was meant. With key given, reading stops at the
defline after key's record, so the only repeat seen, and concatenated, is one
that follows it directly; a second record of key further on is never read,
and the one sequence returned is the first's alone. That is the price of
stopping early, and README.md says so. A repeat of any other defline is not
looked for either: finding it would mean keeping every defline read on the way
to key, a hash of 400,000 keys for one record of a proteome.

A defline with a CR inside it, once the whitespace at its end is gone, dies:
it is what a file whose lines end in CR alone (classic Mac OS) has, since with
no LF the whole file is one line, and up to 2026-11-10 such a file came back as
one record named by all of it, with no sequence. Biopython, which opens a file

/*The genotype counts behind sex_check().

The method is peddy 0.4.3's sex_check() (peddy/peddy.py): on X outside its
pseudo-autosomal regions, count each sample's heterozygous and homozygous-ALT
calls at biallelic sites, leaving out a genotype whose depth is below a
minimum. Its PAR bounds, X:10000-2781479 and X:154931044-156030895, cover both
GRCh37's and GRCh38's, so no build need be named. It departs from peddy in
three ways. Every site is read, where peddy stops at 10,000. Only SNVs are
counted, where peddy keeps an insertion (its test is len(REF) > 1 alone). And
peddy's cohort filters (a call rate of at least 0.5, an ALT frequency of at
least 0.01) are left out, since they mean nothing for a VCF of one genome,
which is the usual input here.

Non-PAR Y is counted too, for the caller to see, but decides nothing: on
2026-10-18 the mother's exome, whose X is plainly female (2,592 het to 2,673
hom-ALT), had 530 called SNVs on non-PAR Y, and the father's exome had 659.
Y's PARs are GRCh37's (Y:10001-2649520, Y:59034050-59363566) and GRCh38's
(Y:10001-2781479, Y:56887903-57217415), from the GRC's assembly reports.

counts: each sample's call at an autosomal site sets a bit in one of three
words, for 0, 1 and 2 ALTs, and at the end of a block of 64 sites each pair's
counts are taken from those words by popcount, 8 per pair, where taking them a
site at a time would be 64 tests of the pair's two calls. Own VCFs are each
read into parent_sites, as parent() reads them, and all of them held, and
then merged in one pass, which applies parent_merge()'s rules to each pair.
The files are opened by perl one at a time, so that only one is open.

A pair's counts are REL_T UVs, in the order rel_pair() numbers the pairs: t[1]
to t[8] of parent(), the sites by the first sample's ALT count and then the
second's, flattened as t[3 * first + second] -- t[0], where both are hom-REF,
is not a site compared, and is not kept -- and then, for own VCFs, in[0] to
in[2] of parent_merge(): the sites in both files, in the first's alone and in
the second's alone. For one VCF those three are left 0 and perl fills them.*/

/*The genotype comparison behind concordance().

The method is ~/Scripts/old/x.low_ram_local_concordance.pl's (its
assay_concordance(), concordance() and metrics(), as they stood on
2026-10-19), which compared each sample of a directory of test VCFs with the
same sample in a directory of truth VCFs. Every record of the test is compared,
sample by sample, with the truth's record of the same site, and a site that
the truth lacks is a no-call there; a site that the truth has and the test
lacks is not compared at all. Each comparison is one of the 45 kinds of
CONC_NAME, and the metrics are taken from their counts as metrics() took them.

It departs from that script where the script died or could not match:
- A site is CHROM, POS, REF and ALT. The script also took ID, so that "rs123"
in one file and "." in the other were two sites, and it dropped a "chr" from
the truth's CHROM alone, so that two files that both had one shared no site;
here "chr", in any case, is dropped from both.
- A call is compared as its alleles, in either order, so that "1/0", "0|1" and
"0/1" are one call; the script compared GT strings, and died on the first two.
- A call missing in both ("." and "./.") is concordant_no_call, where the
script made it discordant_no_call_to_no_call, a kind outside its 45.
- A partly missing call ("./1"), one of more than two alleles, and one whose
DP is below min_depth are each a no-call, where the script died on the first
two and had no min_depth.
- The metrics' true positives and true negatives are corrected, and a
discordance of two ALT-carrying calls is a false positive and a false
negative, as the comment above CONC_TP says.

The test is read first, and every site of it kept with its calls for the
samples compared, and then the truth is read a record at a time and looked up
among them. RAM thus goes with the test's sites, which for the usual input, a
panel against a genome, are the fewer, and a truth record that matches no
test site costs no more than finding its end.*/

script's regex picked out of @concordance_types, but for CONC_TP, CONC_TN and
CONC_MISMATCH, which correct it (since 2026-10-19):
- CONC_TP, the true positives, is every concordant kind whose call carries an
ALT. The script's /^conc\w+(?:alt|hom)/ took concordant_hom_ref, by the "hom"
in it, so that a hom-REF site counted as a true positive and a true negative
both, and it left out concordant_het_ref, the commonest true positive.
- CONC_TN, the true negatives, is every concordant kind of reference calls,
whatever the ploidy of either. The script's tn_site,
/^concordant_(?:hom|haploid)\w+ref$/, left out
concordant_diploid_ref_to_haploid_ref, the mirror of a kind it took; and its
tn_genotype was concordant_hom_ref alone, though CONC_FP_REF counts a
haploid-REF truth called otherwise, so that specificity gave no credit for a
haploid-REF truth called right, as on a male's X. Here tn_genotype is
tn_site.
- CONC_MISMATCH is every discordant kind where both calls carry an ALT (0/1
against 1/1, or 0/1 against 0/2), which the script counted in neither
fp_genotype, which was CONC_FP_REF alone, nor fn_genotype, which was
CONC_FN_REF alone, so that it changed no precision or recall. It is now in
both, as benchmarking tools count it: the test's call is wrong, and the
truth's is missed. Specificity still takes CONC_FP_REF alone, since only a
reference truth is a negative.*/

/*The genotypes of a marker panel, for hirisplex_genotypes().

The panel is 41 markers and a VCF of a whole genome is tens of millions of
records, so each record is tested against the panel rather than the panel
searched for in the file. Matching by position tests the chromosome against a
bitmap first, which turns away a record on one test, and reads POS and
searches only when that passes; matching by ID compares the ID column against
the markers' rs numbers. Either way a record that matches nothing is read no
further than its first three fields.

Which allele is counted is perl's to say, from share/hirisplex_s_panel.tsv:
the panel names the allele on the forward strand, so nothing here complements
anything. The allele is looked for among REF and the ALTs, and its place
there is what the genotypes are counted against, so that a site written with
several ALTs, or with the counted allele as its REF, is counted the same way.
A record whose REF is longer than one base is passed over for every marker but
the one that is an indel, since it is some other variant that shares the
position. That one, an insertion, is counted from the ALT that is REF with its
base put in once, which is the same test however the VCF anchors the indel.
Bases are compared regardless of case, as CHROM is.

What is kept is one byte for each sample at each marker, so a file costs one
byte times its samples times the panel, however many records it holds.*/

sites of RHD at which somebody who has the gene almost always differs from

panel of markers cannot say.

One is a record of a deletion that covers the whole RHD gene, which is how
1000 Genomes' phase 3 writes the usual cause of RhD negative (1:25592642,
ALT <CN0>, END=25661222): its genotype is the answer, where the SNVs can only

<DEL> or <DEL:...>, the VCF specification's symbolic alleles, and how far it
runs is INFO's END, or else POS plus SVLEN (VCFv4.2, "INFO keys used for
structural variants").

The other is what the file could have shown. A VCF of one genome usually
lists only the sites where its sample carries an ALT allele, so perl takes a
marker with no record as homozygous REF; that is wrong for a file that could
not have held the record, so each chromosome a marker is on is noted when any
record of it is read, and again when a record of it has an allele longer than
one base, without which a file cannot have held ABO's insertion.
